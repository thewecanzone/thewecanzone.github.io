# Meet the Team: Tai

Hi everyone, I'm Tai! I graduated from UC Berkeley and have a master's degree from NYU in the history of education. I have a passion for education reform and have spent time in the classroom as a first grade teacher, managing special education services at a charter school, and counseling students on the college admissions process. For the past year and a half, I've worked as an education writer, developing curriculum for several e-learning companies. At We Can, I get to share all of the wonderful things the company is doing on social media and make sure that our content is clear and easy to understand. When I'm not working, you can probably find me curled up with a good book or playing with my four-pound mini chihuahua Ramona. I'm looking forward to growing a wonderful community with you!
