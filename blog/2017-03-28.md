# Meet the Team: Charu
Hi everyone, I’m Charu! I graduated from UC San Diego in 2016, and was fortunate enough to join the We Can team in February. My background is in UX design and research, and I’ve worked on all sorts of projects and companies related to education and technology. At We Can, I get to design things, but also make videos, kits, and other fun content for you all! When I’m not working, you can find me outside (I love to camp, hike, kayak and rock climb!), or making my friends and family the guinea pigs for my latest recipe attempt. Enjoy!
