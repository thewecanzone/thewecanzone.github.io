# Meet the Team: Sarah

Hi Everyone, Happy Pi Day!
My name is Sarah and I’m the founder of We Can! My entire life I have loved learning, teaching, and creating. I loved exploring and using my imagination. I got my PhD in computer science from UCSD in 2014 - and I focused all of my research on computer science education, especially how to make teaching and learning computer science more fun, engaging, and effective. In 2017 I founded We Can as a way to share all of the things I have been doing - and to share all of the amazing things that you have been doing! I have so many ideas to share with you, but most importantly I want to help you do what YOU want to do! So never hesitate to reach out and tell me what you want to learn or awesome things you have done so that I can share them with others! When I’m not working, you can probably find me camping or doing yoga with my scientist husband, or playing with my many kittens and my King Charles Cavalier puppy Winston!
