# EDS 124A: Teaching Computation in a Digital World
(Coming Soon)
The following is an example project for the proposed EDS 124A course.

## Pre-Class Assignments
DUE: Tuesday at Noon

This week we are exploring the world-wide sensation "Pokemon Go", how it became so popular, and why it matters. Before class on Tuesday evening, you must complete the following assignments:
1. Behind the technology is the psychology, read through this Ted Blog post about the psychology behind Pokemon Go.
2. Using our Peer Assignment Software (would be embedded in the LMS that we would be using), describe why the personal connection mattered in Pokemon Go's success, and name one other application that might have a similar effect. 
3. Finally, consider the implications of Augmented Reality on the way virtual games are played, do you think personal connections can be more deeply made through an augmented reality game compared to another format?

## In Class Discussion
DUE: Tuesday Evening

During Tuesday's discussion we will explore the implications of Augmented Reality on making Personal Connections.
