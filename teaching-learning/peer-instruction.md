# Peer Instruction
Peer Instruction was developed in the 1990s by Eric Mazur of Harvard. Peer Instruction is a very formatted lecture style that provides students with constant formative assessment. 

Students *do not* learn by being talked to. They learn by solving problems and engaging in critical thinking. Peer Instruction guides students through problem solving and critical thinking. A typical Peer Instruction class session might look like the following:

3-5 minute lecture
Multiple choice question posed to the classroom
Students answer individually
Students given 2-4 minutes to discuss with their neighbors
Students answer as a group (typically 3 to a group)
Instructor discusses the question
Repeat
This particular structure is important to the success of a peer instruction classroom.
