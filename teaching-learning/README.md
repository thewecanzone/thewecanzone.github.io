# Teaching and Learning Principles
Here at We Can, we believe in interactive, engaging courses that use best practices in educational research. Here are some examples of what we offer in our courses. Click through to get more details on each of these evidence-based practices.

## Courses
### EDS 124A: Teaching Computation in a Digital World (Coming Soon)
Are you interested in helping K-12 school-aged kids understand how digital technologies used every day work and how they have impacted society?  If so, this course is for you!

Connected computational technologies are making huge changes in our world.  An ever greater percentage of the population engages with technology multiple times per day.  Everyone needs to have an understanding of the basics behind ubiquitous technologies, the internet which connects so much of our technology, and the ways our technology interactions generate data about us.   In this course we will prepare you to engage K-12 level students with curriculum and learning activities to educate them to be more informed digital citizens.

There are no prerequisites for this course!  But this course may be of interest to pre-service teachers interested in earning the California supplemental authorization to teach computer science courses in K-12.  But this course is intended to be valuable for others!  If you are interested in technology-based after-school clubs, creating online curriculum, games, or interactive approaches to support the education of students who may not have access to computing courses in their schools, or volunteering in schools to help teach computing -- you might benefit from this class!

### Minecraft, Coding, and Teaching
New to coding? Want to learn how to teach coding to your students? Do you have students who love to play Minecraft?

The LearnToMod software combines Minecraft, Coding, and Teacher support for teachers who have never coded on their own, and who have never taught coding! With hundreds of self-guided micro-coding assignments, lesson plans, and project ideas, this education and teacher training course will guide you through the basics of coding with Minecraft, and, more importantly, provide you with the tools and community to help you teach your students how to code in your way!

No previous coding knowledge needed! Some teaching experience recommended.

Taught by instructors who have been teaching novice coding teachers to teach for over a decade, this course will help teachers gain skills to teach coding with Minecraft, but also confidence to learn how to teach other coding topics!
